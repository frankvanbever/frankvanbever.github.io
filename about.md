I'm Frank. During the day I work on embedded systems. These are the tiny computers that are hidden all throughout your daily life. If you notice the work I've done it means I didn't do it right. A lot of this blog will be about that I suppose.
At night I do stress testing of structures by making very loud low frequency sounds through the manipulation of the strings of my bass guitar. A lot of this blog will also be about this I suppose.
According to my girlfriend  I am a very good silly dancer. The blog will not be about that.

Basically if I have something I think is interesting enough to share I'll post it here.
