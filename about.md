I'm Frank. During the day I work on tiny computers. If you notice any of my work it means that I made a mistake. Or maybe you made a mistake. 
At night I do acoustic stress testing of structures by means of manipulating the strings of a Fender Precision Bass guitar and amplifying the resulting signal.
