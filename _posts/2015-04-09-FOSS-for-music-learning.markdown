About a year ago I decided that I was going to pick up my bass guitar again after being on a hiatus for a couple of years.
This was mainly motivated by the feeling that I was spending too much time in front of a monitor (and seeing Bootsy play at Couleur Cafe Festival).
However, being the computer geek that I am I can't help but throw some technology into the mix. This post is about some techniques involving open source software that I use to practice playing bass guitar.

Musescore v2.0 - sheet music playback
=====================================

[Musescore](https://musescore.org/) is an application for music notation. You provide the input and beautiful sheet music comes out at the end. This in itself is handy for those days you get a hard to read handwritten piece of sheet music. Once you get the hang of the application it only takes a couple of minutes to input a normal pop song.

Musescore can also playback the piece, with a tempo you can set yourself. This is what makes it great for practice. Input your sheet music and you can play it back as slow or as fast as you like. The recently launched version 2.0 of Musescore includes another 2 killer features: Measure looping and a metronome. This way you can loop the hardest parts of a song to really nail them down.

Ardour - recording yourself 
===========================

I recently bought a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 USB audio interface. It performs admirably on my Linux system (Mint 17.1 Mate with a lowlatency kernel). I quickly integrated it into my practice routine. What I do is I load up an mp3 or ogg file into Ardour, a DAW, and record myself playing over the original song. I start doing this once I feel I've got the song down playing allong with Musescore. When you listen back to the recording you're confronted with the tiny errors in your playing: strings you don't mute, buzz caused by not fretting exactly right.
