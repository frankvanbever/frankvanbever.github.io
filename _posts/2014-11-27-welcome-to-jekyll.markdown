I'm Frank. I like computers. Especially the kind of computers you can't see. 

Don't worry, this isn't paranoia manifesting itself, it's just that I work with these computers called embedded systems. 
I could try to explain what an embedded system is but Elecia White's definition in her book *Making Embedded Systems* is better than anything I could come up with:

> An embedded system is a computerized system that is purpose built for it's application

Embedded systems range from the tiny computers inside your car which make your life a bit safer to the operating system of the smartphone in your pocket.  
I like the idea of open source software so that's what I try to use as much as possible, both in my work and my personal life.

When I'm not working I like to play bass guitar. I like to combine my love for computers/FOSS and my love for music.

According to my girlfriend I am a gifted silly dancer. 

Basically if I have something I think is interesting enough to share I'll post it here.
